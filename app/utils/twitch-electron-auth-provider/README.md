# Twitch.js - Electron auth provider

This is an {@AuthProvider} implementation for [the `twitch` package family](https://github.com/d-fischer/twitch)
that will automatically pop up a Twitch OAuth dialog in an Electron `BrowserWindow`
as soon as new scopes are requested.

## Installation

To add this library to your project, just execute:
	
	yarn add twitch-electron-auth-provider

or using npm:

	npm install twitch-electron-auth-provider

## Basic usage

To instantiate an {@ApiClient} with this auth provider, just pass it to its constructor:

```ts
import { ApiClient } from 'twitch';
import { ElectronAuthProvider } from 'twitch-electron-auth-provider';

const clientId = 'abc123';
const redirectURI = 'http://foo.bar/login';

const authProvider = new ElectronAuthProvider({
    clientId,
    redirectURI
});

const client = new ApiClient({
	authProvider
});
```

Please note that this currently only works from the *main thread*.

To allow the user to "log out" and change to another account, use:

```ts
authProvider.allowUserChange();
```
